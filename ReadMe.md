## Dependencies


For running experiments with MuSyC model we use [synergy](https://pypi.org/project/synergy/) library.

Demos work with GPflow v.2.0.0, TensorFlow v2.1.0 and TensorFlow probability v0.9.0. For reproducing results with MuSyC model we used [synergy library](https://pypi.org/project/synergy/)

## HandGP
Reproduces experiments with HandGP model.

### Dependencies 
This work depends on the [GPflow project](https://www.gpflow.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as well as the numpy, scipy, matplotlib.\\

Demos work with GPflow v.2.0.0, TensorFlow v2.1.0 and TensorFlow probability v0.9.0. PyMC3 v3.8.

## MuSyC
Reproduces experiments with MuSyC model. Code is based on the library synergy. 

### Dependencies 
For running experiments with MuSyC model we use [synergy](https://pypi.org/project/synergy/) library.

## MedianEffectModel
Reproduces results from Chou & Talalay "Quantitative analysis of dose-effect relationships: #   the combined effects of multiple drugs or enzyme inhibitors." #   Advances in enzyme regulation 1984
