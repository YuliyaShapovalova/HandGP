# HandGP

Predicting synergism using Gaussian processes and Hand principle.\\

## Citation

The underlying algorithm is based on the 2021 paper:

@article{shapovalova2021,
  title={Non-parametric synergy modeling with Gaussian processes},
  author={Shapovalova, Yuliya and Heskes, Tom and Dijkstra, Tjeerd},
  journal={},
  year={2021}
}

## Dependencies

This work depends on the [GPflow project](https://www.gpflow.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as well as the numpy, scipy, matplotlib.\\

For running experiments with MuSyC model we use [synergy](https://pypi.org/project/synergy/)

Demos work with GPflow v.2.0.0, TensorFlow v2.1.0 and TensorFlow probability v0.9.0.
